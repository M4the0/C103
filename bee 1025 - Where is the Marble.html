<div class="description">
<p>
Raju and Meena love to play with Marbles. They have a lot of marbles 
with numbers written on them. In the beginning, Raju would place the 
marbles one after another in ascending order of the numbers written on 
them. Then, Meena would ask Raju to find the first marble with a certain
 number. She would count 1...2...3. Raju gets one point for correct 
answer, and Meena gets the point if Raju fails. After some fixed number 
of attempts, the game ends and the player with maximum points wins. 
Today it's your chance to play as Raju. Being a smart kid, you have in 
your advantage the computer. But don't underestimate Meena, she wrote a 
program to keep track how much time you're taking to give all the 
answers. So now you have to write a program, which will help you in your
 role as Raju.<br></p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<div class="input">
<p>
There can be multiple test cases. The total number of test cases is less
 than 65. Each test case consists begins with 2 integers: <strong>N </strong>the number of marbles and <strong>Q </strong>the number of queries Meena would make. The next <strong>N </strong>lines would contain the numbers written on the <strong>N </strong>marbles. These marble numbers will not come in any particular order. Following <strong>Q </strong>lines will have <strong>Q </strong>queries. Be assured, none of the input numbers are greater than 10000 and none of them are negative.<br>
<br>Input is terminated by a test case where <strong>N </strong>= 0 and <strong>Q </strong>= 0.<br></p>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<div class="output">
<p>
For each test case output there must be a serial number of the test 
case. For each query, write one line of output. The format of this line 
will depend on whether the number is consulted or not written in one of 
the marbles.<br><br> The two different formats are described below:<br>
'<span class="code">x found at y</span>', if the first marble with number x was found at position y. Positions are numbered<em> 1, 2,..., N</em>.<br>
'<span class="code">x not found</span>', if the marble with number x is not present.</p>
